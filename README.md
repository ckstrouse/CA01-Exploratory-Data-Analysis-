What Was Done

Reviewed data structure and summary statistics

Visualized sale price distribution and key relationships

Identified missing values and cleaned the data

Flagged highly correlated features to avoid redundancy

Key Findings

Larger homes and higher quality properties sell for more

Several size-related features are highly correlated

Data is clean and ready for modeling

Outcome

The dataset is prepared for future machine learning with clear insights into important features and potential redundancies.
